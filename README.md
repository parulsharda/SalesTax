Sales Tax Problem
===================================
    Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food,
    and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
    applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

    When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items
    and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items,
    and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for sales tax are
    that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to
    the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
